# Bounce-Rate---MySQL


Pull bounce rates for two groups: '/lander-1' and '/home' to evaluate the new custome page, that is '/lander-1'. Make sure to look
at the time period where '/lander-1' was getting traffic for a fair comparison.

Please upload the schema 'mavenfuzzyfactory' in your MySQL workbench. The link to the file is here:
